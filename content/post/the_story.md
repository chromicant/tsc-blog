## Prelude
The campaign starts as some intrepid explorers answered the call to help fight a war in a faraway
northern kingdom - The Kingdom of Alarond.

The explorers are tasked to find an old magical weapon built by Oskar the Outcast, a wizard of great power
who lived in the lands. He had not been seen for years - so the adventurers were taken to an underground
magical vault where the device was stored. An half-orc barbarian, Gronk, takes our adventurers to the vault.

{{< marginnote >}}There was an inscription to this effect - along with "Turen Creations" as the ones
responsible for the security system. There were also paintings of Oskar and Lord Dorian on the first level
of the vault.{{< /marginnote >}}
The explorers found a vault that was wonderous of nature - master stonework and Gnomish engineering
adorned the halls. Here, the explorers found the vault was created by Oskar and a Lord Dorian.

As the adventurers delved deeper into the underground vault, they fell into a trap. Locked in a room,
the adventurers had two new visitors. Baruk and his companion helped the group escape. Up until this point,
the vault was mostly harmless - but now there were signs of something extremely violent occurring in the vault -
destroyed stonework, burnt books, and undead gnomes.

The adventurers found the weapon...the sentient Black Device. The creation of Oskar and Lord Dorian.
The adventurers realized this item was far, far, too dangerous to give to anyone, and convinced
the weapon to commit suicide.

The adventurers flee the area with Gronk to the small fishing village of Rord.

## Rord
In Rord, many of the adventurers part ways after the traumatic experience. A new batch of adventurers are
in Rord, answering a call for finding fortune.

{{< marginnote >}}The adventurers do try to commit insurance fraud for a dwarf named Thurgrum Grimhorn. The
adventurers, instead of burning down a boat, capture a pirate vessel, and learn that Thurgrum has some connection
to the Dorian family{{< /marginnote >}}
However, Rord has nothing - it's a dead town that has definitely seen better days. A man by the name of Harold
Blackwater, head of the "Defenders of the Iron Hand" - a ragtag group of aging mercenaries, gives the adventurers
a job - find out what's happening in the North. A war is apparently raging, and he wants to know what is going on.

However, travelling in the north without the right paperwork is risky. Harold mentioned there was a hedge
wizard/gentleman farmer named Klas Susidan who may be able to help.

## Klas Susidan and the Abyssal Chickens
The adventurers found the hut of Klas Susidan. After some discussion, Klas agreed to help the adventurers. There
was a druid stealing his chickens, and he wanted the group to teach him a lesson.

The adventurers make it out to the cave where the druid is hiding. They find the druid, a sacrificial altar with a sacrifice,
and chickens that were possessed by demons. After taking care of the druid and abyssal poultry, the adventures
discover the sacrifice was an elf, wearing a robe with an insignia embroidered in it - a iron glove grasping a rose.
A golden pin shaped as an ouroboros in a figure-eight was also found on the body.

On return to Klas's hut, the hedge wizard kept his work, he gave the adventurers a pass to allow them access to
the cities of Krocaster and Deville.

The adventurers head out to Krocaster...

## The Drunken Badger and Krocaster
{{< marginnote >}}Krocaster can best be described as a "one horse town where the one horse got up and left" - very
impoverished, and the group observed all of the harvest was being exported.{{< /marginnote >}}
On the way to Krocaster, the adventurers find an abandoned tavern, *The Drunken Badger*. The place was definitely
deserted, but the bar was still fully stocked, pleasing the motley crew.
 
{{< marginnote >}}While in Krocaster, the group deals with some druids who prove there is a real war
going on by showing a group a skeleton of a demon - a Din'juin. The druids blame the Dorian's for bringing these
demons into the world. While looking for these druids, the group also runs into some Tabaxi hunters
who are clearing out the plains of *literally* all the game animals.{{< /marginnote >}}
The group heads to the farming village of Krocaster the next day. While in the town, they meet Emile Treestar. She's
worried about her friend, who was picked up by the local constabulary and put into prison for something Emile
believed she did not do. The group decided to spring Emile's friend from the prison during the annual harvest
festival. The rationale? The harvest festival is when everyone gets good and drunk - and the local forces will be
overwhelmed...or drunk themselves.

The plan is then set into motion - and the group cannot find Emile's friend. They finally make their way to the top
of the prison tower. Here, they find a torture room, with a strange egg-like sphere in the middle of the room.

The egg-line sphere proves to be a magical prison. The adventurers figure out how to open it, and out from the ooze
dropped a near unconscious female elf - with nothing more than a rose tattoo on her left shoulder. Emile had found her
friend's clothes - a simple white and red robe and a hat. The elf also had her wand returned to her by Emile...

At this time, the guards bust into the room - and begin to panic. They are screaming for backup, and the group springs
into action. The elf makes quick work of the guards with a fireball - which Tremont experiences first hand...without
any injury.

When they get to the floor below - the reinforcements have arrived. Heavily armored war clerics ready themselves for
battle. Emile shows her true nature - she is a front druid, and assists her friend. However, she needs no help - she
summons forth two fire elementals, and the group begins to make a run for it. The elf, however, simply walks by her
elemental minions and starts to make her escape.

On the way out, the prisoner unlocks the bars on the drunk tanks, and now the guards have to deal with a mass crowd of
drunken farmers, two fire elementals, and our intrepid adventurers.

The heroes escape by horse and buggy back to *The Drunken Badger*. There, the heroes learn that the elf is Tasha
Dorian, a member of the Dorian clan. She said she was falsely imprisoned and that she is trying to also figure out
what's going on. She believes that Oskar is at fault - since it was he who murdered her mother and destroyed her
brother.

During the night, Emile and Tasha somehow escape, and stole the ouroboros pin. She also left the map with some new
notations behind. The group decided to head to Deville, since it seems like that was where Tasha was heading.

## Deville
On the way to Deville, the group is spotted by a peasant on the road. Nothing is thought of it.

On arrival to Deville, the heroes find that the town is in a panic. This mining town has lost some miners in a mine,
and need help rescuing them. The heroes are led to the mine, and on exploration, find that orcs have taken prisoners.

On defeat of the orcs, the group make a horrible discovery. The miners are mere boys - 12-16 years old. They also discover
that the mine was one run by Clan Grimhorn, and that black onyx was extracted from the mine.

On return to the town, the town-folk are elated - the group are seen as local heroes. However, one of those saved seems to
be an orphan. Baruk seems interested in the orphan, but for reasons left unexplained.

The group, now well compensated and given papers to enter Frille, head north.

## Frille
On the way north to Frille, the group runs into a Tiefling being hassled by a group of kingdom official *thugs*. One of
the officials confiscates the groups paperwork, and destroys it. A fight occurs, and the Tiefling and the group defeat the
officials, and precede to hide the bodies...and continue north with stolen credentials.

The group enters Frille with no issue, and find a city of wealth and hedonism. They stumble there way to a dining hall
run by a gaunt warlock who's god has commanded him to make the best comfort food in the kingdom. The waitstaff included a
reanimated Beholder, who hooks the group up with some Halflings.

The Halflings are looking for someone to help fix some fights...and the group looks to be just the right people for the job...
